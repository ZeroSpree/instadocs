# InstaDocs!
http://zerospree.github.io/instadocs/

A tool to better organize all your todo's and sticky notes.
Warning! Contains InstaSearch!

### Fuzzy Search
Based on Fuse, by Kiro Risk (http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html) - which means you can mistype search entries and still find what you're looking for.

### Categories
Easily organize your notes into categories.

### Reorder
Drag&Drop items or categories to reorder them or move items from one category to another.

### Extras
**Autosearch:** No need to focus the search field, simply start typing and auto-search will kick-in.

**Copy to Clipboard:** The struggle ends with the convenient click-to-copy feature. (GitHub ssh style!)

**ESC key:** Use it to quickly close modal windows or clear the search input.

**Localstorage:** Everything gets saved directly in your browser. No accounts, no passwords, no fuss.
